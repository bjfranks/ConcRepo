\section{Monotonicity of Petri net extensions}
\subsection{Reset Nets}
Let $N=(S,T,W,R)$ be a reset Petri net.

\textbf{Claim:} Reset Nets are strong, strict and stuttering.

As shown in the lecture Petri nets have all three properties. Need to proof that reset edges do also have the strong property from which the other properties follow. Reset edges consume tokens from one state which doesn't contradict the strong property and therefore the claim follows.




\subsection{Transfer Nets}
Let $N=(S,T,W,R)$ be a transfer Petri net.

\textbf{Claim:} Reset Nets are strong, strict and stuttering.

As shown in the lecture Petri nets have all three properties. Need to proof that reset edges do also have the strong property from which the other properties follow. Transfer edges also don't contradict the strong property from which the claim follows.
